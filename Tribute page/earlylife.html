          British cosmologist Stephen William Hawking was born in Oxford,
          England on Jan. 8, 1942 â€” 300 years to the day after the death of the
          astronomer Galileo Galilei.
        </li>
        <li>
          He attended University College, Oxford, where he studied physics,
          despite his father's urging to focus on medicine. Hawking went on to
          Cambridge to research cosmology, the study of the universe as a whole.
        </li>
        <li>
          In early 1963, just shy of his 21st birthday, Hawking was diagnosed
          with motor neuron disease, more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease
          or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)(opens in new tab).
        </li>
        <li>
          Doctors told Hawkings that he would likely not survive more than two
          years with the disease. Completing his doctorate did not appear
          likely, but Hawking defied the odds.
        </li>
        <li>
          He also obtained his PhD in 1966 for his thesis(opens in new tab)
          entitled "Properties of expanding universes(opens in new tab)". In
          that same year, Hawking also won the prestigious Adams Prize for his
          essay entitled "Singularities and the Geometry of Space-Time".
        </li>
        <li>
          From then Hawking went on to forge new roads into the understanding of
          the universe in the decades since. As the disease spread, Hawking
          became less mobile and began using a wheelchair.
        </li>
        <li>
          Talking grew more challenging and, in 1985, an emergency tracheotomy
          caused his total loss of speech.
        </li>
        <li>
          A speech-generating device constructed at Cambridge, combined with a
          software program, served as his electronic voice, allowing Hawking to
          select his words by moving the muscles in his cheek.
        </li>
        <li>
          Just before his diagnosis, Hawking met Jane Wilde, and the two were
          married in 1965. The couple had three children before separating in
          1990. Hawking remarried in 1995 to Elaine Mason but divorced in 2006.
